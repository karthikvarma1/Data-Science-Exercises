Practical notebooks for COMP6200 2020 S1.

Week1: In this notebook some string manipulations such as printing the lenght of the strings, splitting the words and finding the number            of words. Exploring Python control structures such as conditionals and loops, iterating over any sequence with a for loop. 
       Using the functions in python. Creating the data frames and some plottings with the data.

Week2: Using Markdown to write descriptive text in notebooks. 
       Learning the dictionaries and lists to print desired words in the text and counting the frequent words. 
       Reading the data files into pandas data frames and plotting the data.

Week3: Reading the data fom csv and finding the sixe and shape of the data. 
       Plotting the data to see some visualizations. Creating the data frames and droping the columns using drop method. 
       Comparing the plots with the other. 

Week4: Looking at some more visualizations methods such as seaborn. With the help of a data set used the countplot, boxplot, catplot,              lmplot, scatterplot, heatmap for correlation, pairplot, lineplot and kdeplot. Experimenting with different figure styles.
       
Week5: Exploring the data, building models, making predictions, evaluating results in the first instance using a simple linear least                squares model and will look at two datasets. The first is the standard Iris dataset describing flowers, the second is the AutoMPG            dataset.With the linear regression, fitting the values in the model. Evaluating the model by predicting the variable and using              mean squared error and R2 values to know how well this model fit the data.

Week6: Exploring the data and replacing the na values with mean or median or dropping the values. Plotting a heatmap to find any 
       correlation between variables. Building a logistic regression model to predict. Splitting the data into train set and test set              and predicting the values. For the evaluation process we use accuracy score metrics. This can be obtained by using the Confusion            Matrix. Confusion matrix: [TN,FP,FN,TP]. So that we can easily predict which class is making error. 
       Accuracy= (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN), False Positive Rate = FP/(FP+TN), False Negative Rate = FN/(FN+TP). Feature selection plays a              crucial role in selecting the right features to get a model better. Here we are using Recursive Feature Estimation to select                features for a model.
Week8:
